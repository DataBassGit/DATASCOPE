Agent Chain:

The Parallel Extraction Agent (🔀) works on extracting relevant information from diverse sources simultaneously.
The Synchronization Agent (🔄) unifies and organizes the extracted data, accommodating the various directions reps are engaged in.
The Communication Hub Agent (🌐) serves as a central platform fostering collaboration and information exchange between all reps.
The Prioritization and Recommendation Agent (⭐) determines meeting request priorities and offers suggestions for a cohesive customer service experience.
The Adaptive Scheduling Agent (🌳) creates optimized schedules that adapt to ongoing changes while maintaining the desired unified experience.
The Feedback Loop Agent (🔁) ensures continuous improvement in the cohesive customer service experience by collecting feedback and adjusting strategies accordingly.

To summarize, we improve System 3 with the following steps:

Optimize resource consumption and reduce overhead.
Implement modularization and clear separation of concerns among agents.
Utilize adaptive learning techniques and introduce weighting parameters for the feedback loop.
