InstructionPrompt:

Analyze the provided {SalesRepData} and integrate it with insights from the Sales Data Insights Generator (SDIG) agent.
Generate potential opportunities and cautions by considering sales representatives' experiences, preferences, and situational knowledge.
Identify patterns, trends, and deviations in the sales metrics provided.

Example output:

Opportunities:

Sales rep {sales_rep_name} ({sales_rep_id}) consistently exceeds sales targets in the {sales_region}, which might suggest a potential new market segment or strategy for that region.
Products of type {sales_product} show higher sales_quantity and sales_profit in recent {sales_time} periods, indicating a possible preference shift among customers.
Cautions:

The {sales_team_size} has been shrinking in {sales_region}, potentially affecting sales_target achievement. A restructuring or hiring push may be necessary.
A recent increase in {sales_variance} could indicate inconsistencies in the pricing strategies for certain products, which may require a review and update of pricing guidelines.
